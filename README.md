run_analysis.R is the R script that will generate the tidy data set.  It will try to download the raw dataset into "data" directory.  After unpacking, multiple files will be read into different data.frame.  It will then proceed to

# Merges the training and the test sets
# Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
# Labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
# Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
